Before you decide to review our code, First of all I would like to apologize as to our work is not to your standard. We have been working hard on our assignment but there are alot of problem that we run into
such as combinning our work together. that is why our codes are not usable as it is not merge together yet. So we hope you kindly understand as we are trying our best to live up to your expectation, But sadly we 
could not and we understand that you may be disappointed as you have been so kindly taught us for this semester so we hope you can find it in your heart to forgive us.

Sincerely, From us your student
